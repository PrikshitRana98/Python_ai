#namespace

In Python, a namespace is a system that ensures every name (identifier) in a program is unique and can be used without conflict by mapping names to their corresponding objects


Attribute shadowing occurs when an instance attribute in a Python object has the same name as an attribute defined in its class (or a parent class). The instance attribute "shadows" (hides) the class attribute for that particular object.
